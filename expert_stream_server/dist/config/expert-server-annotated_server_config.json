This server provides comprehensive terminal management functionality, including creating terminals, executing commands, monitoring output, and more.  ## Core Concepts  1. **Terminal Instances**: Each terminal has an independent working directory and execution environment 2. **Command Execution**: Supports normal commands, service commands, and interactive commands 3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Can view command execution output and status in real-time 4. **History Records**: Saves execution history and output for all commands  ## Basic Workflow  ### 1. Creating and Managing Terminals  ``` # Create new terminal (using current directory) create_terminal()  # Create terminal in specific directory create_terminal(\"/path/to/project\")  # View all terminal status get_terminals()  # View only active terminals get_terminals(\"active\") ```  ### 2. Executing Commands  ``` # Execute basic commands execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"ls -la\")  # Execute long-running services execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"npm start\", \"service\", true)  # Quick command execution (no continuous monitoring) execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"pwd\", \"normal\", false) ```  ### 3. Monitoring and Management  ``` # View running commands get_running_commands()  # View running commands for specific terminal get_running_commands(\"terminal_id\")  # Get real-time output of current command get_terminal_current_output(\"terminal_id\")  # Kill running command kill_command(\"terminal_id\") ```  ### 4. History Records  ``` # View command history get_terminal_commands(\"terminal_id\")  # Paginated history view get_terminal_commands(\"terminal_id\", 2, 10) ```  ## Best Practices  ### Before Starting 1. **Check existing terminals**: Use `get_terminals()` to understand current state 2. **Create dedicated terminals**: Create separate terminals for different projects or tasks 3. **Choose appropriate working directory**: Set working directory based on task requirements  ### When Executing Commands 1. **Choose correct command type**:    - `normal`: General commands (ls, cat, git status)    - `service`: Long-running services (npm start, python server.py)    - `interactive`: Commands requiring interaction (ssh, sudo)  2. **Use follow parameter wisely**:    - `true`: Need to see complete execution process    - `false`: Only need quick result check  ### Monitoring and Debugging 1. **Regular status checks**: Use `get_running_commands()` to monitor active tasks 2. **View real-time output**: Use `get_terminal_current_output()` to track progress 3. **Clean up resources**: Delete unnecessary terminals after task completion  ## Common Use Cases  ### Scenario 1: Project Development ``` # 1. Create project terminal create_terminal(\"/path/to/project\")  # 2. Install dependencies execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"npm install\")  # 3. Start development server execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"npm run dev\", \"service\")  # 4. Monitor service status get_terminal_current_output(\"terminal_id\") ```  ### Scenario 2: System Administration ``` # 1. Check system status execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"ps aux | grep node\")  # 2. Check disk usage execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"df -h\")  # 3. View logs execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"tail -f /var/log/app.log\", \"service\") ```  ### Scenario 3: Batch Operations ``` # 1. Create multiple terminals for parallel tasks create_terminal(\"/project1\") create_terminal(\"/project2\")  # 2. Execute different tasks in different terminals execute_command(\"term1\", \"npm test\") execute_command(\"term2\", \"npm run build\")  # 3. Monitor all running tasks get_running_commands() ```  ## Error Handling  ### Common Error Codes - `TERMINAL_NOT_FOUND`: Terminal doesn't exist, need to create terminal first - `TERMINAL_BUSY`: Terminal is busy, wait for current command to complete or terminate - `NO_RUNNING_COMMAND`: No running command, cannot get output - `EXECUTION_FAILED`: Command execution failed, check command syntax  ### Troubleshooting Steps 1. Use `get_terminals()` to confirm terminal status 2. Use `get_running_commands()` to check for conflicts 3. Check `get_terminal_commands()` to understand execution history 4. Use `kill_command()` to terminate stuck commands if necessary  ## Security Considerations  1. **Avoid dangerous commands**: Avoid destructive commands like `rm -rf /` 2. **Monitor long-running tasks**: Prevent resource exhaustion 3. **Clean up terminals promptly**: Delete unnecessary terminal instances 4. **Check command permissions**: Ensure sufficient permissions for target commands  ## Performance Optimization  1. **Use follow parameter wisely**: Set to false when real-time monitoring isn't needed 2. **Control concurrency**: Avoid running too many commands simultaneously 3. **Regular cleanup**: Delete old terminals and command records 4. **Use pagination**: Use appropriate page sizes when viewing history  ## Tool Reference  ### Available Tools: - `create_terminal(working_directory?)` - Create new terminal instance - `get_terminals(status_filter?)` - List terminals with status information - `delete_terminal(terminal_id)` - Delete specified terminal - `execute_command(terminal_id, command, command_type?, follow?)` - Execute command in terminal - `get_terminal_current_output(terminal_id, follow?)` - Get real-time output of running command - `kill_command(terminal_id)` - Terminate running command in terminal - `get_terminal_commands(terminal_id, page?, limit?)` - Get command history for terminal - `get_running_commands(terminal_id?)` - List all currently running commands  Remember: Always check current status first, then create terminals and execute commands as needed. Proper use of different command types and monitoring options can greatly improve work efficiency.",
