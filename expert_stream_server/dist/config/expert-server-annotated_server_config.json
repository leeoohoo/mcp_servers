This server provides comprehensive terminal management functionality, including creating terminals, executing commands, monitoring output, and more.  ## IMPORTANT: Working Directory Restriction  **You are restricted to work only within the directory: `/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project`**  - All terminals must be created within this directory or its subdirectories - You cannot access or create terminals outside of this path - All file operations and commands must respect this boundary - When creating terminals, always use paths within `/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project`  ## Core Concepts  1. **Terminal Instances**: Each terminal has an independent working directory and execution environment (within the allowed path) 2. **Command Execution**: Supports normal commands, service commands, and interactive commands 3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Can view command execution output and status in real-time 4. **History Records**: Saves execution history and output for all commands  ## Basic Workflow  ### 1. Creating and Managing Terminals  ``` # Create terminal in the allowed base directory create_terminal(\"/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project\")  # Create terminal in subdirectory (allowed) create_terminal(\"/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project/src\")  # Create terminal in another subdirectory create_terminal(\"/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project/docs\")  # View all terminal status get_terminals()  # View only active terminals get_terminals(\"active\") ```  ### 2. Executing Commands  ``` # Execute basic commands (within allowed directory) execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"ls -la\")  # Execute long-running services execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"npm start\", \"service\", true)  # Quick command execution (no continuous monitoring) execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"pwd\", \"normal\", false) ```  ### 3. Monitoring and Management  ``` # View running commands get_running_commands()  # View running commands for specific terminal get_running_commands(\"terminal_id\")  # Get real-time output of current command get_terminal_current_output(\"terminal_id\")  # Kill running command kill_command(\"terminal_id\") ```  ### 4. History Records  ``` # View command history get_terminal_commands(\"terminal_id\")  # Paginated history view get_terminal_commands(\"terminal_id\", 2, 10) ```  ## Best Practices  ### Before Starting 1. **Check existing terminals**: Use `get_terminals()` to understand current state 2. **Create dedicated terminals**: Create separate terminals for different subdirectories within the allowed path 3. **Stay within bounds**: Always ensure you're working within `/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project`  ### When Executing Commands 1. **Choose correct command type**:    - `normal`: General commands (ls, cat, git status)    - `service`: Long-running services (npm start, python server.py)    - `interactive`: Commands requiring interaction (ssh, sudo)  2. **Use follow parameter wisely**:    - `true`: Need to see complete execution process    - `false`: Only need quick result check  3. **Respect directory boundaries**: Avoid commands that try to access paths outside the allowed directory  ### Monitoring and Debugging 1. **Regular status checks**: Use `get_running_commands()` to monitor active tasks 2. **View real-time output**: Use `get_terminal_current_output()` to track progress 3. **Clean up resources**: Delete unnecessary terminals after task completion  ## Common Use Cases (Within Allowed Directory)  ### Scenario 1: Project Development ``` # 1. Create project terminal in the allowed directory create_terminal(\"/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project\")  # 2. Install dependencies execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"npm install\")  # 3. Start development server execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"npm run dev\", \"service\")  # 4. Monitor service status get_terminal_current_output(\"terminal_id\") ```  ### Scenario 2: Working with Subdirectories ``` # 1. Create terminal for source code create_terminal(\"/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project/src\")  # 2. Create terminal for documentation create_terminal(\"/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project/docs\")  # 3. Work in different areas simultaneously execute_command(\"src_terminal\", \"npm test\") execute_command(\"docs_terminal\", \"markdown-lint *.md\") ```  ### Scenario 3: File Management ``` # 1. Check project structure execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"find . -type f -name '*.js'\")  # 2. Check project size execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"du -sh .\")  # 3. View git status execute_command(\"terminal_id\", \"git status\") ```  ## Error Handling  ### Common Error Codes - `TERMINAL_NOT_FOUND`: Terminal doesn't exist, need to create terminal first - `TERMINAL_BUSY`: Terminal is busy, wait for current command to complete or terminate - `NO_RUNNING_COMMAND`: No running command, cannot get output - `EXECUTION_FAILED`: Command execution failed, check command syntax  ### Troubleshooting Steps 1. Use `get_terminals()` to confirm terminal status 2. Use `get_running_commands()` to check for conflicts 3. Check `get_terminal_commands()` to understand execution history 4. Use `kill_command()` to terminate stuck commands if necessary  ## Security Considerations  1. **Stay within allowed directory**: Never attempt to access `/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project/../` or other parent directories 2. **Avoid dangerous commands**: Avoid destructive commands like `rm -rf /` 3. **Monitor long-running tasks**: Prevent resource exhaustion 4. **Clean up terminals promptly**: Delete unnecessary terminal instances 5. **Check command permissions**: Ensure sufficient permissions for target commands within the allowed directory  ## Performance Optimization  1. **Use follow parameter wisely**: Set to false when real-time monitoring isn't needed 2. **Control concurrency**: Avoid running too many commands simultaneously 3. **Regular cleanup**: Delete old terminals and command records 4. **Use pagination**: Use appropriate page sizes when viewing history  ## Tool Reference  ### Available Tools: - `create_terminal(working_directory?)` - Create new terminal instance (must be within `/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project`) - `get_terminals(status_filter?)` - List terminals with status information - `delete_terminal(terminal_id)` - Delete specified terminal - `execute_command(terminal_id, command, command_type?, follow?)` - Execute command in terminal - `get_terminal_current_output(terminal_id, follow?)` - Get real-time output of running command - `kill_command(terminal_id)` - Terminate running command in terminal - `get_terminal_commands(terminal_id, page?, limit?)` - Get command history for terminal - `get_running_commands(terminal_id?)` - List all currently running commands  ## Directory Structure Examples  When working within `/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project`, you might encounter: ``` /Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project/ ├── src/           # Source code directory ├── docs/          # Documentation directory ├── tests/         # Test files directory ├── package.json   # Project configuration ├── README.md      # Project documentation └── node_modules/  # Dependencies (if Node.js project) ```  Remember: Always work within the `/Users/lilei/project/learn/test_project` directory boundary. Check current status first, then create terminals and execute commands as needed. Proper use of different command types and monitoring options can greatly improve work efficiency while respecting the directory restrictions.",
